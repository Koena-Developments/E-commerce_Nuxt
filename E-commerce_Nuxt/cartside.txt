Great question! For a profile/settings page like this, here are the functionalities and states that are good candidates to move to Pinia (your user store):

**What to move to Pinia:**
1. **User Profile Data**  
 - The `userProfile` object should be in Pinia, as it's global user state and may be needed elsewhere (e.g., navbar, account menu).
2. **Profile Fetching/Updating Actions**  
 - The logic for fetching and updating the user profile (`fetchUserProfile`, `saveProfileChanges`) can be Pinia actions. This centralizes API logic and makes it reusable.
3. **Profile Loading/Error States**  
 - States like `loadingProfile` and `profileError` can be in Pinia if you want to show loading/errors globally (e.g., in a header or notification area).

**What to keep local (in the component):**
1. **Edit Mode State**  
 - `editMode` is UI-specific and can stay local.
2. **Editable Form State**  
 - `editableUserProfile` is only for the form, so keep it local.
3. **Form Validation/Temporary UI States**  
 - States like `isUpdating` (for button loading) are UI-specific.

**Summary Table:**

| State/Functionality         | Pinia Store | Local Component |
|----------------------------|:-----------:|:--------------:|
| userProfile                |      ✔      |                |
| fetchUserProfile           |      ✔      |                |
| saveProfileChanges         |      ✔      |                |
| loadingProfile/profileError|      ✔      |                |
| editMode                   |             |       ✔        |
| editableUserProfile        |             |       ✔        |
| isUpdating                 |             |       ✔        |

**Why?**  
Pinia is best for global, shared, or persistent state and logic. Local state is best for UI-specific, temporary, or form-only data.

Let me know if you want an example of how to refactor any of these!
